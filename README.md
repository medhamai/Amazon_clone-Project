# Amazon_clone-Project
Created a clone of the Amazon website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with signin page, singup page, add to cart page and a product description page. 
The amazon logo on the top left of the home page helps to navigate to the original Amazon home page. 
The Accounts & Lists section takes you to the signin page from where you can navigate to signup page. 
The cart section opens cart page where you can view your items added to cart. 
The background image on the home page is scrollable and changes slides when the navigation arrows are clicked which was achieved using java script. 
The best selling electronics section (first box displaying products on home page) when clicked opens the product description.
